# Aesthetic Goals
Challenge: Players find the game difficult and is engaged in overcoming the obstacles
- success: 
    Players retry levels until they beat it
    Players think about strategies and routing
- failure:
    Players beat every level first try (too easy)
    Players cheat or give up entirely (too unfair)

Sensation: Players find the game aesthetically pleasing
- success:
    Players spend time looking at sprites
    Players listen to the music non-trivially
- failure:
    Players turn off audio when playing

# Core Loop
In this game, players learn the mechanics, probably die a couple times trying, and beat the level eventually.
A full platformer game would include introducing new mechanics and helping players learn with increasingly difficult levels.
The core loop serves to deliver on the challenge aesthetic, requiring multiple attempts to win and progressively more precise inputs.
It also contributes to the sensation aesthetic by making players stay longer in each area and look at the art.

# Postmortem
- Summarize what you originally set out to do
    I originally set out to make a platformer game that is challenging and visually pleasing. 
    I wanted multiple movement techs (jump, climb, dash) with interesting interplay.
    I also wanted to have pretty sprites and good music for the game.
- Summarize what your goals ended up being by the end
    I couldn't find free game assets that fits my original goal in sensation, so I decided to look for music only.
    I found it overly complicated to learn multiple movement techs in one scene, so I decided to exclude dash and climb jumps.
• Summarize what you accomplished of those goals
    I made the game sufficiently difficult but still quickly learnable. 
    I successfully implemented movement mechanics and the basic core loop within a level.
• What went right?
    Scripting movement and adding sounds felt easier with experience from previous assignment.
• What went wrong?
    Platformer logic is more challenging than I thought, with problems like sticking to walls and going out of bounds.
    I used quick fixes since it's a week-long assignment, so movement doesn't feel very smooth.
• What do you wish you knew at the start of the project that you know now?
    I wish I knew more about finding the right assets as well as how to use them in unity.
    Most assets I found came in large texture maps that felt too complicated to use.
• What did you learn in the process?
    I learned to do bug fixes efficiently, since the game is more collision-based compared to the air fighter I made last week.
